# Script Breathing Trainer

**[🚀 Launch Trainer](https://leonidsvb.github.io/breathe-script/)**

Master your scripts using Alex Hormozi's breathing technique - progressive memorization through random word hiding.

## Quick Start

1. Click the link above
2. Paste your script
3. Set how many words to hide
4. Choose Random or Sequential mode
5. Practice and gradually increase difficulty

## Features

- Progressive word hiding (0% → 100%)
- Random/Sequential modes
- Save multiple scripts locally
- Mobile-friendly
- Works offline

## How It Works

Start with all words visible, then gradually hide more. Random mode prevents pattern memorization - your brain learns the actual content, not positions.
